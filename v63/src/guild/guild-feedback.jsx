// ---------- Guild feedback (local-only today, shaped for a shared service later) ----------
// Feedback guildmates leave on a book published to the Guild — kept as a list per book (not a
// single value, like a personal rating is) so it reads as a thread. Only this device's writer
// exists today, so in practice this is "your own notes on your own guild book" until Inkroot has
// a real shared guild service — GuildBookshelf and GuildBookFeedbackModal say so honestly. The
// shape (an array of { author, stars, note, at }) is exactly what a real multi-member feed would
// need, so nothing here has to change once one exists — new entries just start arriving from
// other members alongside the ones already saved.

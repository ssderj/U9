// Inkroot supports exactly two sign-in methods: Google and passkeys. Password and magic-link
// auth (supabase.auth.signUp / signInWithPassword / signInWithOtp) were removed — no code path
// in this app calls them, and the corresponding password/OTP email flows should also be
// disabled in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Providers so an account can't be
// created or accessed outside these two methods.

// Redirect-based OAuth: Supabase sends the browser to Google, then back to redirectTo with an
// auth code in the URL. supabase-js has detectSessionInUrl on by default, so it exchanges that
// code for a session automatically on load — the existing onAuthChange listener in
// sync-context.jsx picks it up the same way it picks up any other sign-in, no extra wiring
// needed on the receiving end. window.location.origin (not a hardcoded URL) so this resolves
// correctly in dev, preview, and production without per-environment editing. Requires Google to
// be enabled (client ID/secret) in the Supabase dashboard under Authentication > Providers —
// that part can't be done from code.
// Root cause of "Continue with Google does nothing": supabase-js's PKCE flow needs two things
// BEFORE it can even start the redirect — a secure context (crypto.subtle, for the PKCE code
// challenge) and working localStorage (to stash the code verifier so it survives the round trip
// to Google and back). Neither is guaranteed:
//   - crypto.subtle is undefined on any page loaded over plain http other than localhost (e.g. a
//     LAN preview URL opened on a phone), so building the challenge throws immediately.
//   - localStorage.setItem throws in Safari Private Browsing and in several in-app browsers
//     (Instagram/TikTok/Facebook's embedded webview), which sandbox or disable it entirely.
// Either failure happens synchronously inside signInWithOAuth(), before any network request or
// redirect — and since account-sync-control.jsx's onClick handler doesn't await this promise
// chain at the React level the way a thrown (rejected) promise expects, that rejection used to
// vanish as a silent "Uncaught (in promise)" with zero visible UI change: exactly the reported
// symptom. Checking both preconditions up front, with a specific message for each, turns that
// silent failure into an actionable one instead of a caught-but-unexplained generic error.

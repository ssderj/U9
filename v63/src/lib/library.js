// Every function here is safe to call whether or not the reader is signed in — publishing,
// reviewing, and following are all opt-in account features layered on top of an app that fully
// works without one (same philosophy as syncEngine.js in Phase 1). Each function checks for a
// session itself rather than expecting the caller to track auth state, so App.jsx's publish/
// unpublish handlers don't need to know anything about sign-in status to call these safely.

// Pushes (or updates) a book's public listing. Called after a local publish/re-publish — the
// project's full content never leaves kv_store; this only sends the subset that's meant to be
// public (title, subtitle, seriesName, cover, blurb, genre, tags, wordCount, price, destination).
//
// subtitle/seriesName/cover/wordCount exist so a real author's public books (see
// lib/profile.js's fetchPublicProfile and authors-hall-screen.jsx's publicBooks) can render as
// full display cards on someone else's device, not just a title/blurb/genre stub — see
// 26_migration_published_books_richer_metadata.sql for why these weren't here originally, and
// publishBookToGuildRemote in library-guild.js for the guild-scoped counterpart this mirrors.
//
// No author_name here — the author's display name is looked up live from `profiles` by
// author_id whenever a listing is read (fetchAuthorRatingsSummary's callers, follow-based
// screens), instead of being copied onto this row at write time. See profile.js's syncProfile
// for why: a denormalized copy here would go stale the next time the writer changes their pen
// name, and nothing left in this file re-syncs it.
// NOTE ON ERROR PROPAGATION (fix-tracker item 26 follow-up, publishing reliability pass): the
// Supabase JS client's query builder is a thenable that always *resolves* to `{ data, error }` —
// it never rejects on its own for a normal database error (RLS denial, constraint violation,
// etc.), only for a genuine network/transport exception. Every mutation below therefore awaits
// its own call and explicitly throws when `error` comes back set, so a `.catch()` anywhere
// upstream (see lib/publish-flow.js) actually fires for a real failure instead of only for a
// dropped connection. Before this, `publishBookRemote(...).catch(...)` call sites could — and
// silently did — treat a rejected RLS write as a success.

// moment that socket closes (tab closed, app backgrounded and killed, connection dropped)
// Realtime's own heartbeat expires their entry and every other subscriber's next 'sync' event
// reflects that automatically. There's nothing to poll, nothing to write, and nothing that can
// go stale the way a last-seen timestamp can.

// never cross), selfName is what this device tracks about itself once subscribed (just enough
// for a future "who's online" list to show something nicer than a bare id, though today's UI
// only reads presence keys, not payloads), and onSync is called with a fresh Set of online user
// ids every time the channel's presence state changes — including once, synchronously-ish, right
// after the initial subscribe. Returns an unsubscribe function; call it on unmount or whenever
// guildId changes, or a stale channel keeps this device tracked in a guild it's no longer
// viewing.
//
// Signed-out callers get a single onSync(new Set()) and no channel at all — same "no real signal,
// don't fake one" honesty every other lib/*.js wrapper in this app follows for a signed-out
// writer, rather than opening a channel that can never track anyone.

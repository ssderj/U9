// copy (see authorDisplayName() and fetchProfileNames() below) — every reader of those tables
// looks the current name up from `profiles` live, via this same row, so a pen name change takes
// effect everywhere the moment this update lands. An earlier version of this function had to
// separately fan a name change out to all five of those tables (propagateDisplayName) precisely

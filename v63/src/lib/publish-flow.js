// ---------- Publishing reliability (fix-tracker item 27) ----------
//
// THE BUG THIS FILE FIXES: every publish/unpublish call site (ink-root.jsx's setPublishStatus /
// publishBookWithDetails / setPackPublishStatus / publishPackWithDetails, and — worse —
// project-workspace.jsx's handleSetPublishStatus / handleWizardPublishBook /
// handleSetPackPublishStatus / handleWizardPublishPack, which never made a single remote call at
// all) wrote the local "Published" status FIRST, then fired the remote listing/content/guild-shelf
// pushes afterward as non-blocking, uncaught promises (`.catch(e => console.warn(...))`). Three
// separate ways that produced a broken book:
//   1. The writer's own screen showed "Published" the instant the local write landed — before
//      Supabase had done anything at all, let alone finished.
//   2. lib/library.js's own mutation functions returned the Supabase query builder directly,
//      which resolves (never rejects) to `{ data, error }` on a normal database error — so even
//      the `.catch()` that WAS there could never fire for an RLS denial or constraint violation,
//      only for a dropped connection. See the notes added directly above each mutation.
//   3. If the listing (published_books) succeeded but the content mirror
//      (published_book_content) failed, nothing rolled the listing back — a reader anywhere but
//      the author's own device would find the book in the Grand Library/Guild Bookshelf, tap it,
//      and hit an empty/broken manuscript forever, with no local sign anything was wrong.
//
// THE FIX: publishBookRemoteFlow / publishPackRemoteFlow below run the listing and content
// mutations in sequence and AWAIT each one. A local "Published" write only happens in the
// caller once this whole flow resolves. If the content step fails after the listing step
// succeeded, the listing is rolled back (deleted) before the error is thrown, so a listing with
// no content is never left standing. The guild-shelf mirror is intentionally a step outside
// that contract — see the comment on it below.
export class PublishFlowError extends Error {}

// `listing.cover` / `content.cover` are the project's own cover object (see form-fields.jsx's
// CoverPicker) — its `customImageUrl` is normally a short Storage URL, but stays a `data:` URL on
// this device when an upload to Storage never succeeded. published_books, published_book_content,
// and guild_published_books are all publicly/guild-readable, so that raw base64 must never reach
// any of them (#26) — stripped once here, at the single point every book publish/re-publish path
// funnels through, rather than in each of the three remote-write functions separately.

// {customImageUrl} object like a book's — see publishing.jsx's ImagePicker usage for pack
// covers), but it's the exact same failure mode: ui-primitives.jsx's ImagePicker falls back to
// the raw base64 `data:` URL when its Storage upload fails (`onChange(uploadedUrl || dataUrl)`),
// and published_packs is publicly readable (fetchDiscoverPacks serves cover_image_url to every
// Grand Library visitor, no purchase needed) — same #26/R10 bug class, just never closed here.

// a console.warn and the writer was told the rollback had happened ("nothing was left
// half-published") — untrue exactly when it mattered (audit finding #14). Now they're told the
// truth and what to do: Publish again re-runs the whole flow (the listing upsert is idempotent and
// the content step gets another go), or Unpublish removes the listing. `partial = true` marks it
// for any caller that wants to treat it differently; today's callers (ink-root.jsx and

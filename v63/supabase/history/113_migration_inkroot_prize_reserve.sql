-- Migration 113: Inkroot-hosted events could promise any cash prize with nothing set aside
-- to pay it (production audit, High).
--
-- The gap: create_guild_event()'s host='inkroot' branch only checked that the caller is an admin
-- and that the prize is positive. A guild-hosted guaranteed prize is escrowed in the guild's own
-- treasury (migration 108), but an Inkroot-hosted prize was just a number on the event row: any
-- admin (or a compromised admin session) could publish "₦5,000,000 prize" that Inkroot could not
-- pay, and settle_guild_event() would then credit the winners' guild treasury with money that was
-- never funded — which the guild could withdraw.
--
-- What this adds:
--   1. platform_reserve_kobo — an append-only ledger of Inkroot's own prize reserve. Rows:
--        top_up                — operator adds funds (credit)
--        withdrawal            — operator removes unreserved funds (debit)
--        event_prize_reserved  — debited when an Inkroot-hosted event is created
--        event_prize_released  — credited back if that event is cancelled before settlement
--        event_prize_settled   — recorded when the event settles (no effect on the available
--                                balance: the funds were already taken out at reservation; this
--                                just closes the reservation so it is never released afterward)
--      available = top_ups + releases - reservations - withdrawals. Update/delete are blocked by a
--      trigger that fires for every role, same as guild_treasury_transactions.
--   2. create_guild_event()'s host='inkroot' branch refuses to create the event unless the prize
--      fits inside the available reserve, and debits the reserve in the same transaction, under a
--      dedicated advisory lock so two concurrent event creations can't both spend the same funds.
--   3. settle_guild_event()'s host='inkroot' path closes the reservation (event_prize_settled).
--   4. cancel_guild_event() and admin_cancel_guild_event_dispute() release the reservation when
--      they cancel an Inkroot-hosted event — otherwise cancelling one would strand its funds.
--   5. top_up_platform_reserve() / withdraw_from_platform_reserve() — the only sanctioned writers of
--      the operator rows. Callable ONLY from the SQL editor / service role, never from an app
--      session: if an admin session could top up the reserve, it could mint its own funding and
--      the check above would prove nothing. See PAYMENTS.md, "Inkroot prize reserve".
--
-- IMPORTANT — what this is and isn't. The reserve is an accounting control, not a bank check:
-- a top-up is the operator declaring "I have set this much aside" (in the Paystack balance or the
-- company bank account); nothing here can verify real money. What it does guarantee is that no
-- Inkroot-hosted prize can be published beyond what an operator has explicitly declared funded,
-- and that an admin account alone can't raise that ceiling.
--
-- Existing events: Inkroot-hosted events created before this migration have no reservation row.
-- They settle exactly as before (no reserve interaction) rather than being blocked, since
-- refusing to pay out an already-announced prize would be worse than the gap being closed. To fund
-- them into the ledger, top up the reserve and reserve them by hand; to see which are still open:
--     select id, title, cash_prize_kobo from guild_events
--      where host = 'inkroot' and status = 'open'
--        and not exists (select 1 from platform_reserve_kobo r
--                        where r.event_id = guild_events.id and r.kind = 'event_prize_reserved');
--
-- AFTER APPLYING: the reserve starts at zero, so creating an Inkroot-hosted event fails until an
-- operator tops it up, e.g.
--     select top_up_platform_reserve(50000000, 'Initial prize reserve');   -- ₦500,000
--
-- Safe to run anytime: one new table, and the changed functions only gain checks on paths that
-- previously had none (the Inkroot branch of create; Inkroot handling in cancel/settle).

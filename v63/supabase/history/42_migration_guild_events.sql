-- Migration 42: Guild Events — the second real revenue source the Guild Treasury's generic
-- distribute_guild_revenue() engine (see the Guild Revenue Distribution migration) was always
-- built to support via its reserved kind='event_revenue'/source='event_sale' vocabulary. Two
-- funding shapes, both landing in the same place once verified:
--   - host = 'guild': the guild itself hosts a competition with a real entry fee. Anyone signed
--     in can pay to enter (guild_event_entries, a small purchases-shaped table with its own
--     Paystack reference and the exact same pending -> success/failed webhook lifecycle
--     `purchases` already has). Inkroot's platform fee (PLATFORM_FEE_BPS, same constant and same
--     formula as an ordinary book sale) is applied per entry as it's paid, not at settlement, so
--     a later fee-schedule change never reclassifies an already-paid entry.
--   - host = 'inkroot': Inkroot itself funds a cash prize for a guild's members directly — no
--     entry fee, no reader payment, so no platform fee applies (Inkroot isn't taking a cut of its
--     own money). Only ever created and settled by Inkroot directly (there's no admin role or
--     admin UI in this app to gate it behind, so this is enforced the only way that's actually
--     true today: create_guild_event()/settle_guild_event() both refuse to act on a host='inkroot'
--     row for any caller with a real auth.uid() — i.e. any signed-in app user — leaving only a
--     direct service-role/SQL action, run by Inkroot outside the app, able to do it).
--
-- Either way, "settling" an event is the one moment real money moves: the guild owner (or,
-- for an Inkroot-hosted prize, Inkroot itself) declares winner shares among that guild's own
-- members, and settle_guild_event() computes the verified pool (summed successful entry fees,
-- net of the platform fee already applied per entry; or the fixed cash prize) and hands it to
-- distribute_guild_revenue() — the exact same engine, same rounding, same permanent-ledger
-- guarantee an Anthology sale already goes through. "Credit each member's earnings" + "credit
-- the guild's share" + "record every transaction in the ledger" all happen inside that one
-- shared function, not duplicated here.
--
-- Duplicate-processing protection, layered the same way the Anthology wiring documents it:
--   a. guild_events.status only ever moves open -> closed -> settled (or open -> settled), and
--      settle_guild_event() re-checks that status under an advisory lock keyed to the event
--      before doing anything, so two concurrent settle calls can't both pass.
--   b. distribute_guild_revenue() itself (modified below to accept an event, not just a
--      purchase, as its dedup key) independently checks whether any ledger row already
--      references this event before writing anything — belt-and-suspenders even if (a) were
--      ever bypassed.
--   c. Each entry fee payment has its own paystack_reference-scoped, `.eq('status','pending')`
--      webhook update, same as a purchases row — a retried Paystack webhook event can't mark
--      (or pay for) the same entry twice.
--   d. A person can enter a given guild-hosted event at most once (unique (event_id,
--      entrant_id)) — a deliberate scope choice (one ticket per person), not a technical
--      limitation of the underlying tables.
--
-- Winners must be real members of the guild whose event this is — settle_guild_event() checks
-- every declared contributor_id against player_guild_members before distributing anything,
-- same "never trust a client-supplied id" posture as everywhere else in this ledger.

-- 69_migration_founder_guild_parity.sql
--
-- Gives Founder Guilds a real backend with the same treasury/anthology/event privileges as
-- Player Guilds, using the Inkroot platform admin (profiles.is_platform_admin) as every Founder
-- Guild's officer — per product decision, since a Founder Guild has no single owner the way a
-- Player Guild does. Run this once against an existing database; supabase/schema.sql has the
-- same end state folded in for fresh installs.
--
-- Deliberately NOT touched by this migration (see the reply that shipped it for the full
-- reasoning):
--   * founder_guild_members (roster) — already real, untouched, still the source of truth for
--     who's actually in a Founder Guild.
--   * guild_order_chapters / guild_order_passages (Manuscript/Roster tab) — already real for
--     both guild types, using its own merit-based standing check (published book >= 15k words)
--     instead of an owner/officer check. Left as-is; unrelated to what was asked.
--   * Referral-reward attribution (owner_id = p_referee_id, 4 call sites) — has no sane Founder
--     Guild equivalent since there's no single referee to credit. Stays Player-Guild-only.
--   * World Bible / Workshop / Competition tabs — remain simulated for BOTH guild types (an
--     existing, pre-existing design decision unrelated to Founder-vs-Player parity).

-- ============================================================================================
-- Founder Guild parity — Founder Guilds materialized as real player_guilds rows.
--
-- Until now, everything hanging off player_guilds.id (guild_anthologies, guild_treasury_
-- transactions, guild_events, guild_event_hosting_fee_payments, guild_event_financial_
-- agreements — the entire money-moving side of a guild) only ever pointed at a Player Guild.
-- A Founder Guild (the 10 fixed lore guilds — see FOUNDER_GUILDS in guild-hall.jsx) had no row
-- here at all, so none of that could ever apply to one; its Anthology/Treasury tabs stayed
-- permanently simulated (see guild-order.jsx's HONESTY NOTE / ARCHITECTURE.md).
--
-- Rather than adding a parallel founder_guild_id column to every single one of those tables
-- (doubling every join, every RLS policy, and every RPC signature), this migration gives each
-- of the 10 Founder Guilds one real, fixed-id row in player_guilds itself. Every table and
-- function that already speaks "guild_id uuid references player_guilds(id)" now works for a
-- Founder Guild automatically, with zero further schema changes downstream.
--
-- A Founder Guild row is distinguished by is_founder_guild = true and a stable founder_slug
-- (matching FOUNDER_GUILDS[].id client-side: 'fantasy', 'romance', etc.) instead of an owner_id
-- — nobody personally owns a Founder Guild the way a Player Guild's founder does. Its "officer"
-- authority (treasury spend, revenue agreements, hosting fees — anywhere a Player Guild check
-- would look at owner_id) is delegated instead to whichever profile(s) carry is_platform_admin,
-- by Inkroot's own decision that the platform admin (and anyone they appoint via that same flag)
-- acts as every Founder Guild's officer. See is_guild_officer()/is_guild_member() below — the
-- single place this rule is decided, so every call site listed above agrees with the UI.
--
-- founder_guild_members (membership/roster — already real, see the Guild Presence migration) is
-- deliberately left untouched: it's still the one source of truth for who's actually in a
-- Founder Guild, keyed by the same text slug it always used. is_guild_member() below bridges the
-- two — reading player_guild_members for a Player Guild, founder_guild_members for a Founder
-- Guild — rather than migrating membership rows into player_guild_members, which would have
-- meant reshaping a table (and every trigger/RLS policy already built on it) that already works.
